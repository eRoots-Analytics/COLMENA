FROM coinor/coin-or-optimization-suite

# Now, add your instructions to install Python, Pyomo, and your test script
# This image already contains many COIN-OR solvers like Ipopt, Cbc, Cgl, Clp, etc.
# You will likely need to install Python and Pyomo on top of it.

# Example of what you might add next:
# Install Python 3 and pip (if not already present in the base image, you'd need to check its contents)
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    python3 python3-pip && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Pyomo
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir pyomo

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your test script
COPY test_pyomo_ipopt.py .

# Run your test script
RUN python3 test_pyomo_ipopt.py

# Set default command
CMD ["bash"]
